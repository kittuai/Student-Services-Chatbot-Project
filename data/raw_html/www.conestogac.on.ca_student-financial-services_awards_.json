Awards are monetary supports which recognize outstanding achievement and contributions to the Conestoga community. Awards include grants, scholarships, and bursaries, and are given based on a combination of criteria including merit, community involvement, or financial need. Bursaries are primarily based on financial need. Bursaries may include other criteria for selection such as a program of study, gender, or background. Scholarships are generally given for exceptional academic performance and may include consideration of other forms of earned merit. What awards are available through the General Awards Application (GAA)? Each term, students who complete a GAA are automatically considered for all awards, scholarships, and bursaries for which they meet the eligibility criteria. For a complete list of available awards, please see the directory above. Do I need to complete the application in one sitting? No. The 'Save as Draft' button will create a link to your drafted GAA and will be sent to your Conestoga email. You may return to this draft to complete your application any time before the deadline. Can I update my application after I have submitted it? You may not update your General Awards Application (GAA) after it is submitted. However, you may complete a new GAA with updated information. As only your most recent application is considered, please ensure it is complete. I missed the application deadline. Can I still submit my application? No. To ensure equity and objectivity in recipient selection, Student Financial Services is unable to accept late applications. I am a part-time student. Can I apply for awards? No. Only students who are registered in a program full-time (or have a reduced courseload accommodation through Accessible Learning) may apply. I am an international student. Can I apply for awards? Yes. International students must complete a General Awards Application to be considered for awards, including awards given by the Office for International Students. International students are not eligible for bursaries or awards which require financial need (student visas require demonstration of sufficient funds to cover post-secondary expenses). I am on co-op this term. Can I apply for awards? No. Students in a co-op or Career Management in Canada (GCM) term are not eligible to submit a General Awards Application. Students are encouraged to apply when they return to classes. Why can't I access the awards application? For eligible students (those registered in a full-time program and not on a co-op/GCM term), the grey 'personal information' fields on the General Awards Application are filled automatically. Please contact awards@conestogac.on.ca for assistance if you have trouble accessing the General Awards Application and believe you are eligible. When will I know if I am receiving an award? Students selected to receive awards, scholarships, or bursaries are notified through their Conestoga email address. These announcements are communicated throughout the term and may follow the submission of end-of-term grades. Only students chosen to receive awards are contacted. What does it mean if I am shortlisted for an award? If you meet the basic criteria for an award (e.g. a minimum GPA, specific program, etc.), you may receive an invitation to complete a Supplementary Application. This provides additional information needed to choose an award's recipient, such as a statement on a specific topic, details related to community or campus involvement, and/or documents such as a resume or letter of reference. Being shortlisted does not guarantee you will receive an award. I submitted the application. Why didn't I receive an award? Completing the awards application does not guarantee you will receive an award. Each award has unique selection criteria, which you may not have met.
