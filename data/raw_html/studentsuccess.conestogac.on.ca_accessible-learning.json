You must complete your Semester Request at the start of each semester to activate your accommodations and notify your faculty. Semester Requests should be submitted a few days before your semester begins. Remote learning Students who cannot come to campus for an extended period and are looking for academic accommodation for courses only offered in person/on campus are encouraged to speak with us before seeking documentation. These situations tend to have a fair amount of complexity and, when requested for a duration greater than two weeks, can generate additional barriers to academic success and participation. If you are already registered with us, please speak with your Accessibility Advisor. If you haven't been assigned an Accessibility Advisor yet, please contact our intake team. Note: In Ontario, accommodations at the post-secondary level cannot change required learning outcomes. As such, some essential activities may only be completed on campus (e.g., hands-on learning). Documentation If you have a documented permanent or temporary disability or are experiencing difficulties that affect your learning, you can register for academic accommodations. Accommodations are determined with your Accessibility Advisor based on: your needs your program requirements your documentation Depending on your accommodation needs, our office may request additional, updated, or more specific documentation. Receiving this documentation before your first appointment will help us provide an accommodation plan more quickly. Please note: While recommendations will be considered, the college reserves the right to determine the most appropriate accommodations in our context. Our goal is to reach a consensus with you about this, but if you believe we have made an error, you may request an appeal. Submit your documentation If you are new to Accessible Learning, documentation can be uploaded via our Intake Form. Alternatively, it can be uploaded to Accommodate, emailed, faxed, or submitted in person. OSAP Disability Verification OSAP requires that a Disability Verification Form (DVF) be completed and uploaded to the student\u2019s OSAP profile on the OSAP Portal for Student Financial Services to confirm permanent or temporary disability. Disability verification with OSAP may allow students to access awards, scholarships, grants, and bursaries. Students must also provide Accessible Learning with a copy of the completed DVF or other relevant medical documentation to implement academic accommodations as needed. Please note: If you have checked the disability box on your OSAP application but have not completed and uploaded the Disability Verification Form, it may delay your OSAP funding until Student Financial Services confirms disability verification. You may request Student Financial Services to uncheck the box until you have the documents in place. Using the same email address you used in your OSAP application, email Student Financial Services with your name and student ID number, requesting to remove your disability status. Your status will be adjusted once the completed DVF form is uploaded onto your OSAP student profile and Student Financial Services confirms your disability. Who can verify a permanent disability? Documentation to confirm a permanent disability may be provided by a qualified healthcare practitioner with training and experience in the area of diagnosis. Examples of qualified practitioners include: Audiologists Chiropractors Occupational Therapists Optometrists Ophthalmologists Nurse Practitioners Physicians Physiotherapists Psychiatrists Psychologists Speech-Language Pathologists Documentation for a physical or mental health condition Options of supporting documentation include: OSAP Disability Verification Form (DVF) Conestoga's Health Certificate Form (pdf) Medical Letter (including name, title, professional credentials, licensure/certification information of the assessing professional that indicates the student's limitations or needs in the academic setting) Psychoeducational Assessment Report Please note: this may allow for academic accommodations, however, an assessment completed when the student was at least 18 years of age or within the past five years may be required to access funding for equipment and/or services. Individualized Education Plan (IEP) that references a physical or mental health condition. Please note: your IEP may provide valuable information to help us understand what support was available in high school, however, additional documentation may be required depending on the accommodation request.
