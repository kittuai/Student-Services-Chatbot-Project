A career refers to the total work-related experiences an individual has over the course of their life (e.g., an electrician). A job refers to a specific set of duties performed in a specific place (e.g., a self-employed photographer working from home). An occupation is a cluster of related duties that can be performed at various locations for different employers (e.g., engineer). Work means systematic and goal-directed activities that result in outcomes valued by the person working and/or by society. Work can be paid or volunteered. What is labour market information? Labour market information is the information you need to make sound decisions about your future. It includes information about occupational options, training programs, employment opportunities, industry growth and anything else you might want to know before making an employment-related decision. Why do I need to know about the labour market? Because career decisions are so important, you'll want to make sure you are well-informed when making your choices. That's where labour market information plays a key role. Every week, we hear stories about the job situation in different industries and how some occupations are growing and others are not. You'll be able to make an informed decision by interpreting labour market information and decide how much weight to give it when you are making career choices. You'll be able to anticipate trends and see how they may affect decisions you are making. You'll need to consider things like: occupational informationindustrial informationlabour market and social trendseconomic and political trends How do I learn about trends and the labour market? There are many different ways to explore trends and labour market research. For example: printed sources, audio/video/electronic sources and word of mouth. Useful websites for Occupation Research & Labour Market information Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada Canadian Careers Government of Canada Job Bank Ontario's labour market National Occupational Classification (NOC) Skilled Trades Ontario Work in Canada How do I get information \u2018first hand' or by word of mouth? One of the most effective methods of obtaining more detailed information about a particular career is to conduct an information meeting with someone who holds a position that interests you. Information meetings are beneficial because they allow you to: Explore careers and clarify your career goal Expand your professional network Build confidence for your job interviews Access the most up-to-date career information Identify your professional strengths and weaknesses See the organization from the inside Information meetings do not mean you ask for a job. They are meetings that allow you to ask questions to find out information you need to make an informed, confident decision about your future. You should do information meetings with people who are in the career that you are interested in, the supervisors of the position you are interested in, and graduates of training programs you may be considering. With all the changes in the workforce, have the skills employers look for changed? Yes, as workplaces change and evolve, employees need to adapt to remain employable. The Conference Board of Canada developed a list of transferable, generic skills that employers look for in new employees grouped under fundamental skills, personal management skills and teamwork skills. Additionally, the Government of Canada and other international/national agencies have validated this and further defined nine essential skills that individuals need for learning, working and living. Towes: Essential Skills Employment and Social Development Canada : Essential Skills What about working for myself? Is it a good idea? Many trends have opened the door for small business startups. Small business is full of risks and rewards and many grow into large enterprises. Do your research and analyze your skills to determine if you will be a good business owner and if your plan will be successful. Government of Canada: Starting a business What are recruitment firms? I see so many listed on job postings. Recruitment firms are businesses that have grown out of some of the trends of outsourcing human resources duties. Many firms hold contracts with employers to find employees to fill short-term or permanent vacancies. There are many types of firms and they go by a variety of names, such as headhunters, employment agencies, or staffing services. Get to know who does what and find out how they can work for you while you transition to a new career.
