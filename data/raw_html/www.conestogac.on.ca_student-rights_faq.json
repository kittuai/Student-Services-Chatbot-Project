It is important to understand that expectations for confidentiality depend on why you are engaging with our office. Concerns If you reach out to our office with a concern, your conversation with the SRRO is confidential unless we have reason to believe that you are at risk of harming yourself or someone else, or if you disclose that another person is at similar risk. Excluding situations of imminent risk or harm, we will not advance your concerns without your permission. Violations If we reach out to you because your conduct was reported to our office, we may disclose status reports, outcomes, and other relevant information to involved parties such as the violation reporter and any impacted areas of the college. How does the SRRO protect my privacy and confidentiality? All records are filed in a secure electronic database. Managing these records is the responsibility of the SRRO under the direction of the Associate Vice-President, Student Affairs. Access to these records is restricted to appropriate college staff as per the requirements and principles in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). Exceptions are records under statutes that expressly state that they prevail over FIPPA. Can I report concerns anonymously? We accept anonymous reports, but anonymity can limit our ability to review or address your concerns. If you do not want to disclose your identity, we will not be able to report back to you about the status or outcome of your concerns. To submit an anonymous report, you can contact us from an unknown phone number or email address without disclosing your name.
