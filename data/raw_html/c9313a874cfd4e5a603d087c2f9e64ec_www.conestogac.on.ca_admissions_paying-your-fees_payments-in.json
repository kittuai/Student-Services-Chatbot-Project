The confirmation of enrolment process takes place about one week before the start of each term. Your enrolment will be confirmed when: You have paid your deposit You have an approved ONE Card photo on file Your OSAP application is complete and you have received an assessment You do not have any outstanding fees on your student account (returning students) Receiving your funds Once your enrolment has been confirmed the amount for your tuition will be sent directly to the college.

If you previously paid your fees to complete your registration and your OSAP funding has been posted to your student account, you can request a refund of the double payment. For further information, please contact us using the Registrar's Office Contact Form .

A student will be considered in default and not in good financial standing when the payment due date is not adhered to.

If account continues to remain unsettled, the account information will be forwarded to the Finance Office for further action. A financial hold is placed on student's record which will not allow registration and/or achievement information to be released. Enrolment in future terms will be removed. Please note : each transaction charged back by the payer and/or financial institution will incur a $35.00 NSF - Returned Payment Charge. Reduced tuition for students with permanent disabilities Students with a permanent, persistent or prolonged, documented disability who require a reduced course load as a learning accommodation may be eligible to pay a reduced tuition fee to complete their program. Students are required to identify themselves with Accessible Learning and present documentation confirming the disability and the need for a reduced course load as an accommodation. Applications are completed with your Accessibility Advisor. Details related to eligibility are set out in the Tuition and Ancillary Fees Reporting Operating Procedure . Eligibility criteria Eligibility for reduced tuition rates will commence once the student has paid full tuition fees for the entire program. If you are on a reduced course load as an accommodation and have paid the equivalent of full tuition for the program, your course fees will be adjusted to $20 per course (plus college ancillary, course materials, and online learning fees), until you complete your program. Payment of course fees at the regular rate are required at the time of registration. Adjustments and reimbursement (if applicable) are completed within 4-6 weeks after the refund deadline each term. Only the fees paid towards successfully completed courses will be included in this calculation. This policy does not cover courses that you need to take again due to late withdrawal or unsuccessful completion. This policy only covers one program even though you may have changed programs over the time you were registered. If you register in a different program, a new application must be submitted. Students are required to pay all required ancillary fees for each term they are enrolled at the college. Full rules for eligibility The total tuition fees to be paid before a student is eligible to pay the reduced fee must equal the tuition fees a student completing the same program in the approved duration would pay if taking the program in the same academic years and terms, as well as delivery format (i.e. compressed). This includes any applicable annual tuition fee increases. A Student is required to pay all applicable ancillary fees for each term in which they are enrolled at the college. Only the fees paid towards successfully completed courses will be included in this calculation. If the student paid the part-time fees for the term in which a failure occurred, the amount of fees paid towards the course is equivalent to what the student paid. This amount should be deducted from the cumulative total of fees paid. If the student paid full-time fees for the term in which a failure occurred, the value of the failed course should be calculated by pro-rating the full-time fees based on student contact hours per course taken in that term. This amount should be deducted from the cumulative total of fees paid. The fees paid towards any courses/terms from which a student withdraws are not included in the cumulative total of fees paid. Students transferring with advanced standing between post-secondary institutions and/or programs must have paid the equivalent in fees as a student undertaking the same program of study in the approved program duration with the same advanced standing before being eligible for the reduced fee. The calculation of fees to be paid in order to be eligible for the reduced fee is not calculated in relation to fees already paid. Calculating fees to be paid is to be based on the amount of fees to be paid to complete the program in the Ministry-approved duration. Students returning to a program after a period of interruption must have their standing first evaluated according to the academic policies of the college to determine their program level. Once this has been determined, they will pay the equivalent in fees as a student undertaking the program of study in the approved program duration entering at the same program level and academic term before being eligible for the reduced fee. This is the same approach to calculating eligibility as for students transferring with advanced standing. As noted above, the calculation of fees to be paid in order to be eligible for the reduced fee is not calculated in relation to fees already paid. Calculating fees to be paid is to be based on the amount of fees to be paid to complete the program in Ministry-approved duration.

A student will be considered in default and not in good financial standing when the payment due date is not adhered to. Fees clerk/officer will apply a late fee to all outstanding accounts/payments received after the due date. Fees clerk/officer will notify students regarding outstanding fees. If account continues to remain unsettled, the account information will be forwarded to the Finance Office for further action. A financial hold is placed on student's record which will not allow registration and/or achievement information to be released. Enrolment in future terms will be removed. Please note : each transaction charged back by the payer and/or financial institution will incur a $35.00 NSF - Returned Payment Charge. Reduced tuition for students with permanent disabilities Students with a permanent, persistent or prolonged, documented disability who require a reduced course load as a learning accommodation may be eligible to pay a reduced tuition fee to complete their program. Students are required to identify themselves with Accessible Learning and present documentation confirming the disability and the need for a reduced course load as an accommodation. Applications are completed with your Accessibility Advisor. Details related to eligibility are set out in the Tuition and Ancillary Fees Reporting Operating Procedure . Eligibility criteria Eligibility for reduced tuition rates will commence once the student has paid full tuition fees for the entire program. If you are on a reduced course load as an accommodation and have paid the equivalent of full tuition for the program, your course fees will be adjusted to $20 per course (plus college ancillary, course materials, and online learning fees), until you complete your program. Payment of course fees at the regular rate are required at the time of registration. Adjustments and reimbursement (if applicable) are completed within 4-6 weeks after the refund deadline each term. Only the fees paid towards successfully completed courses will be included in this calculation. This policy does not cover courses that you need to take again due to late withdrawal or unsuccessful completion. This policy only covers one program even though you may have changed programs over the time you were registered. If you register in a different program, a new application must be submitted. Students are required to pay all required ancillary fees for each term they are enrolled at the college. Full rules for eligibility The total tuition fees to be paid before a student is eligible to pay the reduced fee must equal the tuition fees a student completing the same program in the approved duration would pay if taking the program in the same academic years and terms, as well as delivery format (i.e. compressed). This includes any applicable annual tuition fee increases. A Student is required to pay all applicable ancillary fees for each term in which they are enrolled at the college. Only the fees paid towards successfully completed courses will be included in this calculation. If the student paid the part-time fees for the term in which a failure occurred, the amount of fees paid towards the course is equivalent to what the student paid. This amount should be deducted from the cumulative total of fees paid. If the student paid full-time fees for the term in which a failure occurred, the value of the failed course should be calculated by pro-rating the full-time fees based on student contact hours per course taken in that term. This amount should be deducted from the cumulative total of fees paid. The fees paid towards any courses/terms from which a student withdraws are not included in the cumulative total of fees paid. Students transferring with advanced standing between post-secondary institutions and/or programs must have paid the equivalent in fees as a student undertaking the same program of study in the approved program duration with the same advanced standing before being eligible for the reduced fee. The calculation of fees to be paid in order to be eligible for the reduced fee is not calculated in relation to fees already paid. Calculating fees to be paid is to be based on the amount of fees to be paid to complete the program in the Ministry-approved duration. Students returning to a program after a period of interruption must have their standing first evaluated according to the academic policies of the college to determine their program level. Once this has been determined, they will pay the equivalent in fees as a student undertaking the program of study in the approved program duration entering at the same program level and academic term before being eligible for the reduced fee. This is the same approach to calculating eligibility as for students transferring with advanced standing. As noted above, the calculation of fees to be paid in order to be eligible for the reduced fee is not calculated in relation to fees already paid. Calculating fees to be paid is to be based on the amount of fees to be paid to complete the program in Ministry-approved duration.

Note: For international students, the mandatory non-refundable tuition deposit is $2,500. The tuition deposit is included in the student's tuition fees and subsequently reduces the tuition owed. Paying fees with OSAP Total OSAP funding Funding information is available on the OSAP website . You may also view the amount of OSAP available to pay your fees on the Student Portal . If OSAP is not enough to cover your fees, you must pay the tuition amount not covered by your OSAP by the fees due date. You will be charged a late fee if you do not pay the difference by the due date. Confirmation of enrolment OSAP will automatically remit fees to the college when we confirm your enrolment. The confirmation of enrolment process takes place about one week before the start of each term. Your enrolment will be confirmed when: You have paid your deposit You have an approved ONE Card photo on file Your OSAP application is complete and you have received an assessment You do not have any outstanding fees on your student account (returning students) Receiving your funds Once your enrolment has been confirmed the amount for your tuition will be sent directly to the college. The funds will take seven to ten (7-10) business days to appear on your student account. If you previously paid your fees to complete your registration and your OSAP funding has been posted to your student account, you can request a refund of the double payment. For further information, please contact us using the Registrar's Office Contact Form . Tuition fee payment default If the student fails to comply with their tuition fee due date, Conestoga has the right to apply late fees, deny release of academic information (transcript), place the student on a financial hold, refuse future and or deny program/course registration, and/or forward the outstanding fee information to a collection agency. A student will be considered in default and not in good financial standing when the payment due date is not adhered to. Fees clerk/officer will apply a late fee to all outstanding accounts/payments received after the due date. Fees clerk/officer will notify students regarding outstanding fees. If account continues to remain unsettled, the account information will be forwarded to the Finance Office for further action. A financial hold is placed on student's record which will not allow registration and/or achievement information to be released. Enrolment in future terms will be removed. Please note : each transaction charged back by the payer and/or financial institution will incur a $35.00 NSF - Returned Payment Charge. Reduced tuition for students with permanent disabilities Students with a permanent, persistent or prolonged, documented disability who require a reduced course load as a learning accommodation may be eligible to pay a reduced tuition fee to complete their program. Students are required to identify themselves with Accessible Learning and present documentation confirming the disability and the need for a reduced course load as an accommodation. Applications are completed with your Accessibility Advisor. Details related to eligibility are set out in the Tuition and Ancillary Fees Reporting Operating Procedure . Eligibility criteria Eligibility for reduced tuition rates will commence once the student has paid full tuition fees for the entire program. If you are on a reduced course load as an accommodation and have paid the equivalent of full tuition for the program, your course fees will be adjusted to $20 per course (plus college ancillary, course materials, and online learning fees), until you complete your program. Payment of course fees at the regular rate are required at the time of registration. Adjustments and reimbursement (if applicable) are completed within 4-6 weeks after the refund deadline each term. Only the fees paid towards successfully completed courses will be included in this calculation. This policy does not cover courses that you need to take again due to late withdrawal or unsuccessful completion. This policy only covers one program even though you may have changed programs over the time you were registered. If you register in a different program, a new application must be submitted. Students are required to pay all required ancillary fees for each term they are enrolled at the college. Full rules for eligibility The total tuition fees to be paid before a student is eligible to pay the reduced fee must equal the tuition fees a student completing the same program in the approved duration would pay if taking the program in the same academic years and terms, as well as delivery format (i.e. compressed). This includes any applicable annual tuition fee increases. A Student is required to pay all applicable ancillary fees for each term in which they are enrolled at the college. Only the fees paid towards successfully completed courses will be included in this calculation. If the student paid the part-time fees for the term in which a failure occurred, the amount of fees paid towards the course is equivalent to what the student paid. This amount should be deducted from the cumulative total of fees paid. If the student paid full-time fees for the term in which a failure occurred, the value of the failed course should be calculated by pro-rating the full-time fees based on student contact hours per course taken in that term. This amount should be deducted from the cumulative total of fees paid. The fees paid towards any courses/terms from which a student withdraws are not included in the cumulative total of fees paid. Students transferring with advanced standing between post-secondary institutions and/or programs must have paid the equivalent in fees as a student undertaking the same program of study in the approved program duration with the same advanced standing before being eligible for the reduced fee. The calculation of fees to be paid in order to be eligible for the reduced fee is not calculated in relation to fees already paid. Calculating fees to be paid is to be based on the amount of fees to be paid to complete the program in the Ministry-approved duration. Students returning to a program after a period of interruption must have their standing first evaluated according to the academic policies of the college to determine their program level. Once this has been determined, they will pay the equivalent in fees as a student undertaking the program of study in the approved program duration entering at the same program level and academic term before being eligible for the reduced fee. This is the same approach to calculating eligibility as for students transferring with advanced standing. As noted above, the calculation of fees to be paid in order to be eligible for the reduced fee is not calculated in relation to fees already paid. Calculating fees to be paid is to be based on the amount of fees to be paid to complete the program in Ministry-approved duration.

For a list of deposit due dates, refer to Student fee invoices and payment . When are student invoices posted? Invoices are posted on the Student Portal 4-6 weeks before the deposit due date . Does the initial deposit count towards tuition fees or is it in addition to my total fees? The $500 mandatory tuition fee deposit (for domestic students) is part of your tuition fees and reduces the amount you owe. How does the deposit work? Does it have to be paid each term? The Ministry of Colleges and Universities policy states that a deposit is assessed on a per program/per academic year basis. Therefore, in a normal situation (no program change) the student pays it once per year. Can I pay my deposit now? The billing of fees will take place in early June at which time fees may be paid. If I am an OSAP recipient do I have to pay the deposit? Yes, if you are receiving OSAP funding you must pay the tuition deposit by the deposit deadline.
