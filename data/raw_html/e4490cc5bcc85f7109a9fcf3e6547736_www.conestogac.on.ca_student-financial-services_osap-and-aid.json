Managing your OSAP Your OSAP loans are an important part of your financial life. Everything you need to know about your OSAP can be found on the OSAP website . It is the most comprehensive and up-to-date resource that you need. While there, familiarize yourself with information about eligibility and status, the interest-free period, repayment, and more. Upon receiving any OSAP funding, you assume the following responsibilities: To read and follow all the terms and conditions in the Master Student Financial Assistance Agreement (MSFAA) Agree to use this funding to first pay your tuition and fees, then to cover other educational and living expenses related to your studies. Report changes to your personal status and program information to OSAP Maintain academic progress Make appropriate repayment arrangements with the National Student Loans Service Centre (NSLSC) when you cease full-time studies. The provincial and federal governments take these responsibilities very seriously, and so should you. If you fail to meet the obligations of your OSAP funding, the possible consequences include: Reassessment and/or reduction of your OSAP entitlement Grant to Loan conversion Refusal of future OSAP assistance Additional interest charges Collection proceedings Impacts on credit rating Reporting changes on your OSAP application Any changes to your studies, personal circumstances, or financial situation may impact your OSAP eligibility or assessment. You must report the following changes as soon as possible. Changes to your course load If you have added or dropped courses, upload a completed OSAP Change Request form (pdf) to the OSAP Portal . Any changes must be reported to OSAP and may result in a reassessment of your funding. Reducing your course load from full-time to part-time If you have dropped below a 60% course load (40% for students with a permanent disability or persistent or prolonged disability), you are considered a part-time student. Your OSAP application will be updated to reflect the date you dropped to part-time status, and your OSAP funding may be reassessed. Increasing your course load from part-time to full-time If you have applied for part-time OSAP and are taking a course load of 60% or greater (40% or greater for students with a permanent disability or persistent or prolonged disability), you may be eligible for additional funding. Change your program of study For students who applied for and received OSAP funding in their first term and are now changing programs or repeating the same term, you must submit a new OSAP application for your current term. Withdraw from your studies You will need to submit the Withdrawal Request form through the Student Portal . We will update your OSAP application and refund any balance on your student account back to the National Student Loans Service Centre on your behalf. Personal changes Personal changes may include: marital status personal or familial financial situation birth of a child name change any major life event which would have an impact on your finances Upload a completed OSAP Change Request form (pdf) and the appropriate supporting documentation to the OSAP Portal .

You may also upload an OSAP Change Request form (pdf) to the OSAP Portal . You must outline the amount of your income, the period for that income, and where that income is coming from (i.e., government funding, employment, scholarships, etc.). Be as accurate as you can, as this information is verified by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Failure to progress academically You must complete and submit your Acknowledgement of Academic Probation form (accessed via the OSAP Portal ) if you are continuing your studies in the next term. Transcripts may also be required, please check communication in the OSAP Portal to confirm. It is recommended that you review the information on OSAP Academic Progress .

The National Student Loans Service Centre provides guidance on all repayment and interest inquiries. OSAP academic requirements To remain eligible for full-time OSAP, a student must make satisfactory progress in their program of study. Students must achieve passing grades in a minimum of 60% (40% course load for students with a permanent disability or persistent or prolonged disability) of a 100% course load based on the expectations of your specific program. Students must also progress through the successive years of their program of study. The following actions are all considered failure to progress academically: Multiple program switches Dropping from a full-time course load to a part-time course load Withdrawing from your program Repeating courses Failing to actively participate in courses (not attending classes, not submitting assignments, not writing exams) Academic progress Students may be required to provide proof of academic progress for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: Changing programs Breaks in studies Repeating courses/levels You have submitted multiple OSAP applications in an academic year What to do if you need to submit an Academic Progress Letter You must complete an Academic Progress Letter (pdf) If you have previously been enrolled in a college/university program, you must submit transcripts of your grades: Conestoga Students \u2013 provide a copy of your Achievement Record from the Student Portal Studies at another college or university - submit transcripts from the other institution(s). Official transcripts may not be required. The document must include the school's name and your full name. OCAS screenshots/transcripts are not accepted. Upload the letter and your transcript(s) to the OSAP Portal . Repeating a course Students who are progressing through their program would generally receive OSAP funding only once for each course in their program. In some circumstances, students may be considered for OSAP funding to repeat one or more courses once provided that they are making academic progress. For example: A student who has failed a course can receive OSAP funding one additional time to try for a better mark. Any additional attempts will not be funded. A student who has not achieved the minimum average or grade required for advancing to the next level of their current program may repeat one or more courses to bring up their average once. Any additional attempts will not be funded. A student has taken an extended break in their studies and, due to significant changes in the program content, they are required to repeat one or more course(s) that were completed before the break. A letter from the program coordinator outlining the need to re-take the courses is required in these cases. Periods of study plus one Students may apply for full-time OSAP for the number of periods of study normally specified by the institution for completion of that program of study plus one (1) study period. For example: A student in a 1-year certificate program can receive a maximum of two years of full-time OSAP assistance. A student in a 2-year diploma program can receive a maximum of three years of full-time OSAP assistance. A student in a 4-year diploma program can receive a maximum of five years of full-time OSAP assistance. A student who has reached the study period maximum for their program is not eligible for further full-time OSAP for that program. This means that some students who take less than a 100% course load each year, or have failed and have had to repeat courses, may be unable to complete their program before they become ineligible for further full-time OSAP. Notes: A study period is defined as one academic year. Periods of study in which a student did not receive full-time OSAP funding from Canada or Ontario are not included. Students with permanent disabilities and students with confirmed persistent or prolonged disabilities are exempted from this policy. Consequences of failure to meet requirements If students do not meet satisfactory academic progress requirements, their eligibility for further OSAP assistance is impacted. Academic probation The first time you do not meet satisfactory academic progress for OSAP purposes, you will be placed on academic probation for at least 12 months from the date of your unsatisfactory academic progress status. You may be on academic probation for one or more of the following reasons: Your course load dropped below the required minimum 60% of a 100% course load during your full-time OSAP-funded study period (or 40% for students with a documented permanent disability or persistent or prolonged disability) You withdrew from the college during your OSAP-funded study period. You did not pass a minimum 60% of a 100% course load during your full-time OSAP-funded study period (or 40% for students with a documented permanent disability or persistent or prolonged disability) You have changed your program of study too many times without earning a credential. Note: the criteria for OSAP academic progress may differ from the academic progress for your program at Conestoga. You can be in good standing for your program at Conestoga and not meet the OSAP funding requirements, or vice versa. What to do if you have been placed on academic probation You must complete and submit your Acknowledgement of Academic Probation form (accessed via the OSAP Portal ) if you are continuing your studies in the next term. Upload the completed form to the OSAP Portal . Connect with Student Success Services for additional support like academic advising, tutoring, and counselling. Once your academic probation period has passed, your progress will automatically be reviewed to determine your next steps. Academic restriction If there is a second instance of unsatisfactory academic progress, you may be restricted from receiving OSAP funding for at least 12 months.  After your restriction period has ended, you may be eligible for funding for your next study period. Subsequent failures to progress academically will result in longer restrictions up to a final decision of a restriction from receiving all future OSAP funding. What to do if you have been placed on academic restriction If you choose to remain enrolled full-time during the restriction period: You must fund your studies yourself. You can submit a Continuation of Interest-Free Status (CIFS) application at the start of your study period.  This will stop interest charges and prevent prior OSAP loans from going into repayment for the duration of your full-time study period while on restriction. Connect with Student Success Services for additional support like academic advising, tutoring, and counseling. Once your restriction period has passed, email Student Financial Services to request to have the restriction downgraded. If you do not remain enrolled full-time during the restriction period: You must maintain your previous loans with the National Student Loans Service Centre . You must repay your loans as scheduled or apply for Repayment Assistance .
