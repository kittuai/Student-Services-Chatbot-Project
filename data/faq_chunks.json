When are student invoices posted? Invoices are posted on the Student Portal 4-6 weeks before the deposit due date . Does the initial deposit count towards tuition fees or is it in addition to my total fees? The $500 mandatory tuition fee deposit (for domestic students) is part of your tuition fees and reduces the amount you owe. How does the deposit work? Does it have to be paid each term? The Ministry of Colleges and Universities policy states that a deposit is assessed on a per program/per academic year basis. Therefore, in a normal situation (no program change) the student pays it once per year. Can I pay my deposit now? The billing of fees will take place in early June at which time fees may be paid. If I am an OSAP recipient do I have to pay the deposit? Yes, if you are receiving OSAP funding you must pay the tuition deposit by the deposit deadline. What if I am an OSAP recipient and do not have enough money for the deposit? As in the past, there will be a process for students who qualify to request an exception to the deposit amount.

The deposit due date will be in October as the first academic level is during the winter term. Fees and payments Can I still pay the full-year tuition fees? Yes, a student may still pay the full fees as per the Student Fee Invoice but a student does not have to pay prior to the fees due date stated on the invoice(s). Do I have to pay deferral fees? No. The ministry no longer allows colleges to charge a deferral fee and as such, have required colleges to bill by term and permit payment by term. Therefore, students no longer need to request to defer to a later date as the timeframe has been established by the ministry. Can I pay my tuition and deposit in person? No, all in-person payments for program tuition and course registration will no longer be accepted.
